# ROS-turtlesim-project

This repository contains the implementation of a project in the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework. The project involves drawing characters using the turtlesim 2D simulator. Two versions of the project are provided:

1. draw_m.zip:
   - Contains the complete project without the bonus part.
   - Executable using the command `roslaunch draw_m draw_m.launch`.
   - The turtles forming the letter 'M' are not controllable and only rotate, similar to the 'Omega' turtles.

2. draw_m_bonus.zip:
   - Includes the complete project with the bonus part.
   - Also executable with `roslaunch draw_m draw_m.launch`.
   - Offers additional functionality compared to the regular version, allowing control over the 'M' turtles.

Both files contain a 'launch' file, 'scripts', 'CMakeLists', and 'package.xml'. The project is implemented in the 'src' directory of the 'catkin_ws' in a Linux Ubuntu virtual machine.
